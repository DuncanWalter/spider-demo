## Workflow

The only system dependency of this project is nodejs. This project is OS and IDE agnostic, though I recommend a modern text editor. @DuncanWalter uses and recommends `VSCode` (not to be confused with `Visual Studio`).

Assert that you have `node` installed. Open the project directory in a terminal or command prompt. The first time you open the project and anytime the project's dependencies change, you'll need to run:

```bash
npm install
```

This fetches all the project dependencies and lobs thim into the `node_modules` directory. Note that `package-lock.json` is autogenerated and exists to keep our dependencies in sync, so you shouldn't have to run `npm install` often.

Use the following commands (specified in `package.json#scripts`) to interact with and the project.

```bash
# Run Jest tests:
npm run test

# Run dev mode serve:
# Recompiles on save,
# Automatically opens in browser.
npm run dev

# Run prod mode build:
# Compile with minification,
# compression, and prod sources.
npm run build
```

You should be able to configure your work environment to autoformat files on save using the `prettier` configuration found in `package.json` (using the `prettier` extension in `VSCode`, for example). @DuncanWalter would also like to add linting support.

All git commits are guarded by a `husky` precommit check which runs tests and makes sure `prettier` has run over all the files.

## Contributing

- Never work on the `master` branch
- use feature based, kebab-cased names for branches
- Never merge a pull request without review and approval
- Review others' code
- Use 'squash and merge' when merging pull requests
- Prefer `git rebase` over `git merge`
- When making pull requests with UI changes, include screenshots

## Under the Hood

- `React`: Most popular UI library/framework in the world, and for good reason.
- `Rollup`: javascript bundler which, as of Feb. 2018, `Rollup` supports the code splitting and dynamic imports we need to do our jobs correctly.
- `Jest`: Test runner that just works. UI can be difficult to test, but `Jest` will be invaluable if we add `redux` or other abstractions.
- `Typescript`: language pragma which adds type declarations to javascript. It has a structural, algebraic type system.
